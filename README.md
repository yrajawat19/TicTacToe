# TicTacToe

We are going to build a two-player tic-tac-toe game, which we can play in the command-line. Initially, we’ll make an empty game board and then we’ll take inputs from the players and we’ll check for the winning condition and if the whole board gets filled and no one wins, we’ll declare the result as “Tie” and ask users if they want to restart the game.
